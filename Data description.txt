Data description
For this problem, we will get the services of Foursquare API to explore the data of two cities, in terms of their neighborhoods. The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, theaters, art galleries, museums and many more. We selected all Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods in order to understand the size of clusters. We will use machine learning technique, “Clustering” to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data.
